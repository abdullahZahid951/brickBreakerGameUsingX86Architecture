# brickBreakerGameUsingX86Architecture
## Overview
Welcome to my semester project - the Brick Breaker Game! This project is an exciting implementation of the classic brick breaker game, developed using the x86 architecture. As a student, I aimed to create a simple and sophisticated interface reminiscent of early 1990s gaming, providing players with a nostalgic gaming experience.
## Project Scope
The main focus of the project was to develop a retro-style brick breaker game with the following key features:
### Three Challenging Levels: 
The game consists of three progressively difficult levels. In the first level, the ball moves at a slow pace, making it easier for players to control. The slider is also large, providing more room to interact with the ball. As players advance to the second level, the ball speed increases to a moderate pace and the slider size shrinks slightly. In the final level, the ball moves at a fast pace, and the slider becomes even smaller, challenging players to demonstrate their skills.
### Three Lives System: 
To add an element of challenge and strategy, I implemented a three-lives system. Players start with three hearts (lives). If the ball passes the slider three times without being hit, the player loses one life. The game ends if all three lives are lost, and players must start a new game. Maintaining lives becomes crucial for achieving higher scores.
### Score Tracking: 
The game keeps track of the player's score throughout all the missions. Players are encouraged to aim for precision and speed while breaking bricks to achieve the highest score possible.
### Pause Screen
Beautiful Pause Screen is also implemented for real-time gaming experience. 
## Known Bugs
During development, I encountered a minor issue with the ball sometimes passing through obstacles when colliding with them. You are most welcome to solve the problem and commit as you see fit. Another issue will be storing the scores in a .txt file in descending order I'd love your genuine ideas to solve that. 
## Download and Use with Confidence
Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting your journey in the world of programming, your involvement is highly valued. You are free to examine the code, suggest improvements, and contribute to the development of this classic game. I encourage you to download the project, try it out, and even integrate it into your own work. Your valuable insights and contributions will undoubtedly help enhance the gaming experience and make it even more enjoyable for others.
